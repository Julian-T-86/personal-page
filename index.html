        <p>It all started during the global pandemic. <br>I was in a job doing a lot of spreadsheet gymnastics.<br> Pretty soon my curiosity led me to take an advanced course which exposed me to VBA.<br>
        It seemed like magic how writing a few lines of code could achieve sometimes results that impressed my colleagues which, in turn motivated me to learn more.<br>
        </p><hr>
        <p>
            Personal circumstances led me soon to quite this job and went on totally different career path but the flame was already burning inside me.<br> I bought a book on python which I was fascinated by, I started watching tutorials on youtube but that was not enough.<br>
        </p><hr>
        <p>
            I enrolled in a full stack development course which made me fell in love with design.<br>It was mind boggling to me to see how, essentially from nothing, pieces of art could emerge.
